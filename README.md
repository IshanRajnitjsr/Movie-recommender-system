# Movie-recommender-system
A content-based Movie Recommender System built using Python and Machine Learning. It recommends similar movies using cosine similarity and fetches movie posters in real time via the TMDb API. The web interface is developed and deployed using Streamlit.

The core recommendation engine processes features such as genres and keywords to build a similarity matrix, enabling accurate and efficient movie recommendations. Based on the selected movie, the system identifies and displays the top recommended movies in real time.

To enhance the user experience, the project integrates the TMDb (The Movie Database) API for fetching movie posters dynamically. This makes the recommendations visually appealing and more informative. The front-end of the application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly web interface where users can easily search for a movie and view recommendations with corresponding posters.

The application is fully deployable and hosted using Streamlit Community Cloud, allowing it to be accessed through a web browser without requiring local setup. The project follows best practices such as separating the recommendation logic from the UI and securely managing API keys.
